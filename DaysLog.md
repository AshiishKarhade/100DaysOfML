**100 Days Of ML**

**Day 1 : July 29, 2019**
**Today's Progress :** I took the pledge to dedicate at least 1hr a day to learn Machine Learning. 
**Thoughts :** Hope this will be exiciting,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way. Thankyou Siraj Raval. 

**Day 2 : July 30, 2019**
**Today's Progress :** I have started learning Convolutional Neural Networks using Tensorflow. I made a Image Classifier for the cats and dogs dataset.
**Thoughts :** I have done CNN's earlier but never using Tensorflow. This is amazing. I am very excited to learn everything about Tensorflows.

**Day 3: July 31, 2019**
**Today's Progress :** I implemented transfer learning for Convolutional Neural Networks using Tensorflow. I used a pre-trained model called ImageNet for the image classification.
**Thoughts :** Pre-trained models save a lot of time. Use these if only you understand whats going behind it. 

**Day 4: August 1, 2019**
**Today's Progress :** I started learning tensorflow from scratch. That sounds different right because yesterday I was learning CNN with tensorflow. I learnt about the tf.Variables, tf.constants, tf.placeholders, how tf uses graphs to solve its problems
**Thoughts :** I used to think that keras that was what I was using and thinking that tensorflow is pretty easy. Its not the case.

**Day 6, Day 7, Day 8: August 4, 2019 to August 6, 2019**
**Today's Progress :** I took few moments off as my laptop was sick lol. I had to repair it. I learnt the implementation of CNN using tensorflow and tried my knowledge on MNIST dataset and then CIFAR-10 dataset. It was awesome. My model could predict about 92% on MNIST and about 75% on CIFAR-10. There's lot more to learn.
**Thoughts :** I cannot live without my macbook air. The 10 hours when my laptop got faulty were the toughest for me. PS: I use my macbook air 7-hours a day on average.
