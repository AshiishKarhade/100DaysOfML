100 Days Of ML

Day 1 : July 29, 2019
Today's Progress : I took the pledge to dedicate at least 1hr a day to learn Machine Learning. 
Thoughts : Hope this will be exiciting,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way. Thankyou Siraj Raval. 

Day 1 : July 30, 2019
Today's Progress : I have started learning Convolutional Neural Networks using Tensorflow. I made a Image Classifier for the cats and dogs dataset.
Thoughts : I have done CNN's earlier but never using Tensorflow. This is amazing. I am very excited to learn everything about Tensorflows.

Day 2: July 31, 2019
Today's Progress : I implemented transfer learning for Convolutional Neural Networks using Tensorflow. I used a pre-trained model called ImageNet for the image classification.
Thoughts : Pre-trained models save a lot of time. Use these if only you understand whats going behind it.
